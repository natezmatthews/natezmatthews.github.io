If you log in to facebook from Small The World and grant us permission, I collect the latitude, longitude, and name of 25 places you have been tagged. This information is used to place markers on a map, but besides that is not sent anywhere, and will die the moment you close your window. For questions regarding privacy, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:natezmatthews@gmail.com">natezmatthews@gmail.com</a>.
